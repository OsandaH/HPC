Shared Memory & Dynamic Threads
•	Shared variables: Accessible by all threads.
•	Private variables: Only accessed by a single thread.
•	Master thread: Manages tasks and creates worker threads dynamically.
•	Worker threads: Perform tasks, then terminate and rejoin the master thread.
•	Optimized resource usage: Threads only exist when active.

Static vs. Dynamic Threads
Static Threads are created once at the start and have fixed resource allocation. They may lead to idle threads if not fully utilized, as seen in fixed thread pools.
Dynamic Threads are created and destroyed at runtime, allocating resources as needed. This approach avoids unnecessary thread overhead, like a web server spawning new threads for each client.
