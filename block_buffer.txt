Blocking vs. buffering Communication
MPI_Send Buffering & Deadlocks
  Small messages may be buffered, allowing MPI_Send to return immediately.
  Large messages may block, leading to deadlocks if all processes are waiting on MPI_Recv.

Deadlock Example
If all processes execute MPI_Send first and block, none can reach MPI_Recv, causing a deadlock.
Solution:
  Change send/receive order.
  Use non-blocking communication (MPI_Isend, MPI_Irecv).
