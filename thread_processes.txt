Concurrency
  Allows multiple tasks to make progress simultaneously.
  Achieved using processes and threads.
  inter-process communication (IPC): Data exchange between processes.
  Inter-thread communication (ITC): Communication between threads of the same process.

2. Advantages of Using Multiple Processes
Increased Performance: Parallel execution speeds up tasks.
Improved Reliability: One process failing doesnâ€™t affect others.
Better Resource Utilization: Efficient CPU/core usage.
Improved Scalability: Can handle increasing workloads.
Enhanced Security: Process separation limits security risks.

3. Processes
	Instance of a running program.
	Has private memory blocks (stack, heap).
	OS allocates resources using process descriptors.
	Example: A text editor process should not interfere with a browser process.

4. Threads
	Lighter-weight processes within the same memory space.
	Threads share memory except for individual stacks and program counters.
	Used for efficient shared-memory parallelism.
