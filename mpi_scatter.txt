MPI_Scatter (Distributing Data Among Processes)
The MPI_Scatter function is used to distribute chunks of an array from a root process to all processes in a communicator.

MPI_Scatter(void *sendbuf, int sendcount, MPI_Datatype sendtype, 
            void *recvbuf, int recvcount, MPI_Datatype recvtype, 
            int root, MPI_Comm comm);
Variables:
•	sendbuf: Pointer to the data array at the root process.
•	sendcount: Number of elements sent to each process.
•	sendtype: Data type of elements (e.g., MPI_INT).
•	recvbuf: Buffer where each process stores its received portion.
•	recvcount: Number of elements received per process.
•	recvtype: Data type of received elements.
•	root: Rank of the process sending the data.
•	comm: Communicator (MPI_COMM_WORLD).
