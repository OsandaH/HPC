Basics of Caching
	Cache memory is made of SRAM (faster, but more expensive than DRAM).
	Cache stores data in blocks (cache lines) for quick access.
	Cache hit: Requested data is found in the cache.
	Cache miss: Data is fetched from main memory, slowing performance.
	Locality principle: 
	Spatial locality: Nearby memory locations are likely to be accessed soon.
	Temporal locality: Recently accessed data is likely to be accessed again.
