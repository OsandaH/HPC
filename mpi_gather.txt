MPI_Gather (Collecting Data from All Processes)
The MPI_Gather function is used to collect data from all processes and store it in a single array at the root process.

MPI_Gather(void *sendbuf, int sendcount, MPI_Datatype sendtype, 
           void *recvbuf, int recvcount, MPI_Datatype recvtype, 
           int root, MPI_Comm comm);

	sendbuf: Data buffer containing the value each process sends.
	sendcount: Number of elements each process sends.
	sendtype: Data type of elements.
	recvbuf: Buffer at the root process where data is collected.
	recvcount: Number of elements received per process.
	recvtype: Data type of received elements.
	root: Rank of the process collecting the data.
	comm: Communicator (MPI_COMM_WORLD).
