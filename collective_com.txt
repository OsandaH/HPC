Collective Communication

Involves multiple processes working together.

MPI_Bcast(): Broadcasts data from one process to all others.
MPI_Scatter(): Distributes data among processes.
MPI_Gather(): Collects data from all processes.
MPI_Reduce(): Performs operations (sum, max, min) across processes.
MPI_Allreduce(): Similar to MPI_Reduce(), but shares results with all processes.
