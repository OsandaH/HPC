Scheduling Methods in OpenMP
Static Scheduling:
    Iterations are pre-assigned to threads before execution.
    Suitable for uniform workloads.
    Example: #pragma omp parallel for schedule(static, 2)
Dynamic Scheduling:
    Threads request new chunks after finishing previous ones.
    Useful for workloads with varying iteration times.
    Example: #pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic, 2)
Guided Scheduling:
    Chunk size decreases as execution progresses.
    Helps balance irregular workloads.
    Example: #pragma omp parallel for schedule(guided, 2)
Runtime Scheduling:
    Schedule is determined at runtime using OMP_SCHEDULE environment variable.
    Example: export OMP_SCHEDULE="dynamic,4"
