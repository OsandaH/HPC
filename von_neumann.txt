Von Neumann Architecture
Consists of 
  Main memory
  CPU/ Processor/ Core
  connection between CPU and the main memory.
 
Main memory has memory locations to save data and instructions
Memory location has an address to access the location and its contents. 

The CPU can be divided into
  Control unit – decides which instruction to execute 
  ALU – executes the actual instructions.
  Registers – fast storage units which stores data of the CPU and the info about the state of an executing program
  Program counters – special registers to store the address of the next 

Interconnect – transfers instructions and data between the main memory and CPU

Uses a sequential instruction execution model (one instruction at a time).

The Von Neumann bottleneck occurs as both data and instructions share the same bus.

Fetching (reading from memory) and storing (writing to memory) are key memory operations.



Overcoming the Von Neumann Bottleneck
•	Caching: Stores frequently accessed data closer to the CPU.
•	Wider interconnects: Transfers more data per memory access.
•	Pipeline execution: Allows multiple instructions to be processed in stages.
