Parallelizing Loops in OpenMP

Sequential Execution: In a standard for loop, iterations are executed one after another.
Parallel Execution with OpenMP: The #pragma omp parallel for directive distributes iterations among threads.
Block Partitioning: Default OpenMP method assigns iterations in contiguous blocks to threads.
Cyclic Distribution: Distributes iterations more evenly by assigning them cyclically across threads.
Block-Cyclic Distribution: Combines block and cyclic partitioning for better workload balance.
