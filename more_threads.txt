Virtual Memory
  Expands usable memory beyond physical RAM by using disk space (swap).
  Page table maps virtual addresses to physical memory locations.
  Page faults occur when requested data is not in RAM, requiring disk access.

Processes & Multitasking
	Process: A running instance of a program with its own memory and resources.
	Multitasking: 
	Time-sharing: CPU switches between processes using time slices.
	Context switching: Saves and loads process states.

Threads & Multithreading
	Thread: A smaller unit within a process, sharing the same memory.
	Multithreading improves responsiveness and efficiency.
	Example: ATMs handle multiple user transactions using separate threads.


Instruction-Level Parallelism
	Pipelining: Divides instruction execution into stages for higher throughput.
	Superscalar execution: Multiple instructions executed in parallel.

CPU vs Core vs Thread
	CPU: The main processing unit of a computer.
	Core: An independent processing unit within a CPU.
	Thread: A sequence of instructions executed by a core.
