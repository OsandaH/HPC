Scope of Variables in OpenMP
Variables in a parallel region can be shared or private based on declarations.

Types of variable scopes: 
    Shared: Accessible by all threads, modifications affect all.
    Private: Each thread gets its own copy, modifications do not affect others.
    Firstprivate: Like private, but initialized with the value outside the parallel region.
    Lastprivate: Retains the last loop iteration value after parallel execution.
