Race Condition
•	Occurs when multiple threads access and modify a shared resource simultaneously.
•	Leads to unpredictable and incorrect results.
•	Example: Two threads incrementing a counter may interfere, causing incorrect final values.

2. Thread Synchronization
•	Ensures orderly execution in multi-threaded programs.
•	Prevents unexpected behavior and system crashes.
•	Used to coordinate access to shared resources.

3. Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)
•	A synchronization tool that restricts access to a shared resource.
•	Only one thread can access the resource at a time.
•	Threads must acquire a mutex before modifying shared data.
•	Other threads are blocked until the mutex is released.
